5. What you have learned from the project.
   
This project inspired me to think creatively and like an engineer. I discovered that webpages are composed of various pages, much like book chapters. Every page is divided into smaller parts that precisely fit together, much like a puzzle. It demonstrated to me how tidy and well-organized websites may be, despite their crowded appearance. Realizing this opened my eyes to the creative side of website design.
