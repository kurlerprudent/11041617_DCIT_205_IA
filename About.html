        This is the Information Technology age and at its core is Computer Science.
         The study of computer science is therefore critical if society is
          to take full advantage of the benefits Information Technology has to 
          offer and make rapid economic advances.
          Computer science involves the study and development of applications 
          that allow for our everyday use of computers, the software systems that 
          support these applications, and the means and methods used to produce both
          applications and systems that behave reliably, correctly and ethically.
         At the heart of Computer Science lies the skill of computer programming 
         and employers who hire Computer Scientists expect adept programmers with
          knowledge of current techniques and tools and the ability to apply sound 
          engineering principles to the development, construction and maintenance of
           computer programs.
